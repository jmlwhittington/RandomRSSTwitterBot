# RandomRSSTwitterBot
A Twitter bot written in C# using [Tweetinvi](https://github.com/linvi/tweetinvi) and [System.ServiceModel.Syndication](https://www.nuget.org/packages/System.ServiceModel.Syndication/) to tweet a random article from a custom list of RSS feeds at a custom frequency in hours.

To install the bot, download the latest release, drag the folder out of the *.RAR* archive, and place it wherever you intend to store the bot. Run it once to produce a *keys.txt* file, then input your keys there. Run the bot again, and it will create a few more files (a *logs* folder where logs are stored and titled by Unix timestamp, a *sources.txt* file, a *postings.txt* file, and a *frequency.txt* file), then ask how often you want it to run in hours. Type 0 to test it. If the bot ran successfully, it will have posted something from the default feed (Google News' Technology topic). Check out the bot's Twitter feed to see if the post went through!

From here, you can add in your sources' RSS feeds in the *sources.txt* file (one per line). The bot will automatically add titles of posts to the postings.txt file, and will search for another suitable article up to 10 times before giving up until the next pull it makes. You can clear out the logs folder and postings.txt file periodically per your needs. A future release may see the bot clearing out those two periodically on its own. If you decide to remove a source, make sure you remove its frequency entry from the *frequency.txt* file! You can do this by checking the line number of the source in the *sources.txt* file in Notepad, then removing that same line number from both files. If you do not do this, the program will incorrectly calculate the frequency of each souce! Also do not forget to add lines to the *frequency.txt* file when adding sources!

If there is an error to tweet, you will see some reasoning in the console output, but not the log output unfortunately. You can use the timestamp to look at Event Viewer under Windows Logs > Application, however, to see the same output for later.

If you have any questions, feel free to raise an issue!
