# RandomRSSTwitterBot
A Twitter bot written in C# using [Tweetinvi](https://github.com/linvi/tweetinvi) and [System.ServiceModel.Syndication](https://www.nuget.org/packages/System.ServiceModel.Syndication/) to tweet a random article from a custom list of RSS feeds at a custom frequency in hours. The bot runs as soon as the hour turns on this frequency but at the same second you ran it. Example: if you started it at 6:15:29 AM for every 1 hour, it will run at 7:00:29 AM and every hour after at the 29th second.

To install the bot, download the latest release, drag the folder out of the *.RAR* archive, and place it wherever you intend to store the bot. Run it once to produce a *keys.txt* file, then input your keys there. Run the bot again, and it will create a few more files (a *logs* folder where logs are stored and titled by Unix timestamp, a *sources.txt* file, and a *postings.txt* file), then ask how often you want it to run in hours. Type 0 to test it. If the bot ran successfully, it will have posted something from the default feed (Google News' Technology topic). Check out the bot's Twitter feed to see if the post went through!

From here, you can add in your sources' RSS feeds in the *sources.txt* file (one per line). The bot will automatically add titles of posts to the postings.txt file, and will search for another suitable article up to 10 times before giving up until the next pull it makes. You can clear out the logs folder and postings.txt file periodically per your needs. A future release may see the bot clearing out those two periodically on its own.

If you have any questions, feel free to raise an issue!
